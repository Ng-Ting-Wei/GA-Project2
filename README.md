# Next Steps

Future enhancement one: adding rules
Currently, there is no rules within the app that could help the dnd player to find. I don't have enough time to be working on it as it takes more time to implement it into the app.

Future enhancement two: adding how to do character creations
Currently, there are all the information in the app for the users to look for most informations. Veterans dnd players are able to use them to create their characters and other items with it. For newer dnd player, there is no help line for them to help them create their characters. There is not enough time to fit into the app itself.
